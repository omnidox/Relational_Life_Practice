# Project Planning & Documentation Strategy

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This document outlines our systematic approach to building the Relational Life Practice AI Learning Platform, emphasizing thorough planning before implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Documentation Hierarchy

### 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Purpose**: Define what we're building and why  
**Stakeholders**: Product vision, user needs, market positioning  
**Key Sections**:
- Executive Summary & Vision
- Target Audience Analysis
- Core Features & User Stories
- Success Metrics & KPIs
- Go-to-Market Strategy

### 2. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
**Purpose**: Technical translation of business requirements  
**Stakeholders**: Development team, QA, architects  
**Key Sections**:
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements (Performance, Security, Scalability)
- User Interface Requirements
- Integration Requirements
- Compliance & Ethical Guidelines

### 3. Software Design Document (SDD)
**Purpose**: Architectural blueprint and implementation guidance  
**Stakeholders**: Developers, DevOps, future maintainers  
**Key Sections**:
- System Architecture
- Component Design
- Data Models & Database Schema
- API Specifications
- Deployment Architecture
- Security Design

## ðŸ”„ Research & Documentation Process

### Phase 1: Market & User Research (Week 1)
1. **Competitive Analysis** - Analyze existing relationship education apps
2. **User Persona Development** - Define primary and secondary audiences  
3. **Therapeutic Framework Research** - Deep dive into Terry Real's RLT methodology
4. **Technical Feasibility Study** - Evaluate AI/ML capabilities and constraints

### Phase 2: Requirements Definition (Week 1-2)
1. **Draft PRD** - Initial product vision and feature definition
2. **Stakeholder Review** - Validate assumptions and priorities
3. **Technical Requirements** - Define SRS based on PRD insights
4. **Architecture Planning** - Begin SDD with high-level system design

### Phase 3: Design & Validation (Week 2-3)
1. **Detailed Technical Design** - Complete SDD with implementation specifics
2. **Prototype Validation** - Build proof-of-concept for core interactions
3. **Risk Assessment** - Identify technical, ethical, and business risks
4. **Implementation Roadmap** - Break down development into sprints

## ðŸ“Š Success Criteria

- **PRD**: Clear product vision with measurable success metrics
- **SRS**: Comprehensive requirements covering all user scenarios
- **SDD**: Implementation-ready architecture with clear component boundaries
- **Research**: Evidence-based decisions for all major design choices
