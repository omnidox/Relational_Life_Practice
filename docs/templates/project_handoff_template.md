This chat seems to be reaching its size limit. I want you to generate a new version of the above updating the new chat as to where we are and what needs to be completed. then move the old one into archive. you can suggest anything else to ensure that the new chat understands the project for a successful handoff. Also prior to updating the above, ensure that any relevant documentation is properly updated. Then ensure the new chat know what files would be the most important for the new chat to review. Ensure these files are written in the project handoff file for the chat to prioritize.

Once all of the above is finished, please generate a prompt for me to give to the new chat informing them of the project handoff, including telling them about the exact location of the project handoff file.
