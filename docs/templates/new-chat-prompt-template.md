# New Chat Prompt - Relational Life Practice AI Platform

## ðŸŽ¯ **Chat Transition Prompt**

Hello! I'm Rafael Hidalgo, continuing development of my **Relational Life Practice AI Learning Platform** project. This is a new chat within our existing Claude Project.

**Previous Context**: We've been working together extensively in a previous chat within this same Project on foundational planning, requirements gathering, and initial research. The previous conversation reached Claude's maximum conversation length.

**Test Request**: Before we continue, please provide a **comprehensive summary of our previous chat** to confirm you can access the conversation history from other chats within this Project. I need to verify that Project-level context sharing is working properly.

**What I'm looking for in your summary**:
1. **Project Overview**: What are we building and why?
2. **Key Accomplishments**: What major milestones have we completed?
3. **Current Status**: Where are we in the development process?
4. **Next Steps**: What should we be working on next?
5. **Technical Decisions**: What key architecture and technology choices have we made?
6. **File Organization**: What's our current project structure?

**Important Note**: If you cannot access the previous chat history, please let me know immediately. This will help us understand the limitations of Claude Projects cross-chat context sharing.

**Current Project Phase**: Week 1 Foundation & Research (95% complete), preparing for Week 2 RAG Implementation.

Please provide your summary, and then we can continue with our development work!
