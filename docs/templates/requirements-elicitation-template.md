# Requirements Elicitation Session - Initial Discovery

## üéØ Purpose
Gather foundational information to inform PRD development and architectural decisions.

## üìã Key Questions for Product Owner/Stakeholder

### 1. Target Audience & Market Positioning
**Question**: Who is your primary audience - couples seeking relationship help, therapists-in-training, or general consumers interested in relationship skills? Are you planning to launch as a consumer app, B2B tool for therapists, or both?

**Impact on Requirements**:
- User interface complexity and design approach
- Content delivery and progression models
- Privacy and safety requirements
- Marketing and distribution strategy
- Pricing and monetization decisions

### 2. Technical Constraints & Delivery Timeline
**Question**: What's your preferred tech stack and deployment approach? Are you planning for web-first, mobile-first, or cross-platform? What's your target timeline for MVP vs. full product launch?

**Impact on Requirements**:
- Architecture and infrastructure decisions
- Development resource planning
- Feature prioritization for MVP
- Platform-specific requirements
- Performance and scalability needs

### 3. Content Depth & Therapeutic Boundaries
**Question**: How closely do you want to follow Terry Real's specific RLT methodology vs. creating a more general relational skills curriculum? What are your thoughts on the ethical boundaries between educational content and actual therapy?

**Impact on Requirements**:
- Content development and licensing needs
- Legal compliance and liability considerations
- User safety and crisis intervention features
- Professional consultation requirements
- Certification and credentialing aspects

### 4. Business Model & Monetization Strategy
**Question**: Are you envisioning a freemium model like Duolingo, subscription-based, or something else? This affects our technical architecture decisions around user management and content delivery.

**Impact on Requirements**:
- User account and payment system architecture
- Content gating and progression mechanics
- Analytics and conversion tracking needs
- Customer support and retention features
- Revenue optimization capabilities

### 5. AI Integration Philosophy & Scope
**Question**: Beyond conversational practice, where else do you see AI playing a role - personalized learning paths, progress assessment, content adaptation, or therapeutic response analysis?

**Impact on Requirements**:
- AI/ML infrastructure and model selection
- Data collection and privacy considerations
- Personalization algorithm complexity
- Real-time vs. batch processing needs
- Human oversight and safety mechanisms
