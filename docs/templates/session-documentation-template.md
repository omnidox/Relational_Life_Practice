## üí° **Quick Content Capture Tips**

### **During Active Development**
- **Screenshot interesting moments** (architecture diagrams, problem-solving, successful implementations)
- **Note quotable insights** (good one-liners for social media or article headlines)  
- **Track time spent on different activities** (useful for portfolio project summaries)
- **Document decision rationale** (shows strategic thinking to employers)

### **Efficient Capture**
- **Don't interrupt flow** - quick notes only during active work
- **Use voice memos** if typing slows you down  
- **Take photos of whiteboard/notes** rather than transcribing
- **Set 10-minute timer** at end of session for content capture

### **Quality Over Quantity**
- **One great insight** is better than ten mediocre observations
- **Focus on teaching moments** that could help other developers
- **Prioritize unique perspectives** that differentiate your professional story
- **Emphasize human-AI collaboration** as this is cutting-edge content

---

*This template should take 5-10 minutes to complete after each development session*

**üöÄ Remember: Great content comes from great work - capture the journey while building the destination**
