## üéØ **Project Overview**

### **What We're Building**
A **Duolingo-style AI learning platform** for teaching relational skills based on **Terry Real's Relational Life Therapy (RLT)** methodology. The platform combines:
- Complete 12-module evidence-based curriculum architecture (MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH)
- AI-powered roleplay scenarios for safe relationship practice
- Sophisticated gamification with 15+ practice scenarios and 5 interactive tools
- RAG-enhanced AI conversations grounded in Terry Real's complete works

### **Mission Statement**
"Rebuild humanity's capacity for connection by teaching the relational skills that many people have never learned" - making relationship education as engaging and accessible as language learning.
