## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Overview**

### **What We're Building**
A **Duolingo-style AI learning platform** for teaching relational skills based on **Terry Real's Relational Life Therapy (RLT)** methodology. The platform combines:
- AI-powered roleplay scenarios for safe relationship practice
- Gamified learning progression with streaks, XP, and achievements
- Real-life conversation analysis using RLT principles
- RAG-enhanced AI conversations grounded in Terry Real's books

### **Mission Statement**
"Rebuild humanity's capacity for connection by teaching the relational skills that many people have never learned" - making relationship education as engaging and accessible as language learning.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status: Ready for Week 2**

### **What's Complete**
- **Foundation**: Requirements, PRD, project organization
- **Research**: Duolingo methodology, competitive landscape  
- **Content**: Terry Real books acquired and organized
- **Planning**: Week 2 implementation plan ready

### **What's Next** (Week 2 Priority)
