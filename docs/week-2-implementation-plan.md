## üö® **Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans**

### **Technical Risks**
**Risk**: RAG implementation more complex than expected  
**Mitigation**: Start with simple retrieval, enhance iteratively
**Contingency**: Use pre-built solutions (LangChain) if custom implementation delayed

**Risk**: AI conversation quality insufficient  
**Mitigation**: Extensive prompt engineering and testing with RLT scenarios
**Contingency**: Manual conversation examples as fallback, improve AI iteratively

**Risk**: Terry Real content processing challenges  
**Mitigation**: Manual extraction if automated processing fails
**Contingency**: Start with key concepts, expand content library gradually

### **Timeline Risks**
**Risk**: Week 2 scope too ambitious  
**Mitigation**: Prioritize core functionality, defer nice-to-have features
**Contingency**: Focus on AI conversation quality over UI polish
