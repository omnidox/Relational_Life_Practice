Hello! I'm Rafael Hidalgo, transitioning to a new chat session for my **Relational Life Practice AI Learning Platform** project. This is a strategic AI-assisted development project with complete foundation established and ready for technical implementation.

**CRITICAL: Complete Project Handoff Document Available**

Please immediately read the project handoff document located at: 
`D:\Github\Relational_Life_Practice\docs\project-handoff-new-chat.md`

This document contains complete project context, current status, and all essential information for continuation.

**Essential Files Priority (read in this order):**
1. `D:\Github\Relational_Life_Practice\README.md` - Project overview with cost-optimized architecture
2. `D:\Github\Relational_Life_Practice\docs\project-dashboard.md` - Primary workflow authority with current status
3. `D:\Github\Relational_Life_Practice\docs\TSD\technical-specification-document.md` - Implementation-ready technical specs (9.2/10 quality)
4. `D:\Github\Relational_Life_Practice\docs\cost-optimization-strategy.md` - 70%+ cost savings strategy

**Current Status:**
* **Phase 1 COMPLETE**: Revolutionary 12-module curriculum architecture via Custom GPT consultation
* **Phase 2A COMPLETE**: Technical Specification Document + Cost Optimization Strategy (70%+ savings)
* **Phase 2B READY**: RAG System Implementation with cost-optimized stack (immediate next priority)
* **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: RAG system development (8-10 hours) using Chroma + Voyage-3-lite + Claude 3.5 Sonnet

**Key Achievements:**
- Complete 12-module curriculum (vs initial 5-module assumption) through strategic AI consultation
- Technical Specification Document with 6 essential diagrams (9.2/10 professional quality)
- Cost optimization strategy: Claude 3.5 Sonnet + Voyage-3-lite embeddings + Chroma vector DB
- 70%+ operational cost reduction while maintaining premium functionality
- Implementation-ready architecture with risk-assessed technology choices

**Technology Stack (Cost-Optimized):**
- Frontend: React/Next.js
- AI Service: Claude 3.5 Sonnet API (40% savings vs GPT-4)
- Embeddings: Voyage-3-lite (80% savings vs OpenAI)
- Vector DB: Chroma ($0-20/month vs Pinecone $70/month)
- Database: PostgreSQL

**Project Dual Purpose:**
1. **Build working MVP** - Duolingo-style relationship skills platform
2. **Professional portfolio showcase** - Strategic AI collaboration methodology for job search

**Next Action:** Please confirm you can access the handoff document and provide a brief summary of our current status and immediate next priority after reading the essential files.

Ready to continue strategic AI-assisted development with complete foundation established and cost-optimized architecture!

ðŸ“– **Reading Files:** Always permitted - freely analyze, reference, and understand all existing project content.

âœ… **Content Creation & Professional Branding (No Permission Needed):**
- Create, edit, and delete documentation files in /docs, /articles, /media-scripts, and /research
- Maintain README files, project logs, and architectural decision records
- Organize outlines for articles, YouTube scripts, and Medium tutorials
- Track learnings, challenges, and rationales in structured Markdown files
- Build reusable templates and maintain a content calendar
- Prepare and manage all educational content and tutorial deliverables

ðŸ”’ **Technical Product Development (Permission Required):**
Ask before making changes to:
- Code files or technical components (/src, /backend, /frontend, etc.)
- Configuration files, infrastructure definitions, or deployment scripts
- Database schemas, API specifications, or system architecture diagrams
- Any files that directly impact product functionality or runtime behavior

**Proactive Approach:**
- **For content creation:** Don't wait for prompts. Suggest new ideas, draft outlines, and keep running documentation.
- **For technical implementation:** Suggest creation/modification of technical components, but request approval before changing production-level code.
