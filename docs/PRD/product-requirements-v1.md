## üéØ **Executive Summary**

### **Product Vision**
Relational Life Practice is an AI-powered learning platform that makes relationship skills accessible, engaging, and practical through gamified conversational practice and structured learning paths. Inspired by Terry Real's Relational Life Therapy (RLT), our mission is to **rebuild humanity's capacity for connection** by teaching the relational skills that many people have never learned.

### **The Problem**
Western society's emphasis on individualism has created a crisis of connection. People struggle in relationships not due to lack of love, but due to lack of relational skills. Traditional therapy is expensive and inaccessible, while existing relationship apps focus on matching rather than skill development.

### **The Solution**
A Duolingo-style learning platform that teaches relational skills through:
- **AI-powered roleplay scenarios** for safe practice
- **Terry Real's proven RLT methodology** delivered through engaging digital experiences
- **Real-life conversation analysis** to bridge learning and application
- **Gamified progression** that makes difficult emotional work approachable

### **Success Vision**
Users engage "casually, consistently, and with intrinsic motivation" to develop authentic relational skills that improve their real-world connections, while we demonstrate cutting-edge AI application in emotional intelligence and education.

### **Strategic Development Approach**
This project showcases **advanced AI-human collaboration methodology** through strategic Custom GPT consultation for evidence-based curriculum design. The development process itself serves as a portfolio demonstration of professional AI utilization, systematic product development, and modern development practices suitable for senior technical roles.
