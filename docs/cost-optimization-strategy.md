## üöÄ **Technology Decisions & Rationale**

### **1. AI Service: Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
**Why Switch from GPT-4:**
- **Cost**: 40% savings ($15/1M vs $25/1M tokens)
- **Performance**: Comparable to GPT-4o, often superior for reasoning tasks
- **Speed**: Faster response times than GPT-4
- **Context Window**: Large context window suitable for relationship conversations
- **Safety**: Strong built-in safety features appropriate for sensitive content

**Risk Mitigation**: Can easily switch back to GPT-4 if needed - same API patterns

### **2. Embeddings: Voyage-3-lite or Jina v3**
**Why Switch from OpenAI ada-002:**
- **Cost**: 80% savings ($0.03/1M vs $0.13/1M tokens)
- **Performance**: Voyage-3-lite achieves close to OpenAI v3-large performance
- **Quality**: Jina v3 outperforms OpenAI on standard benchmarks
- **Features**: Better multilingual support, longer context processing
- **Independence**: Reduces dependency on single provider

**Implementation**: Process Terry Real corpus with Voyage-3-lite, fallback to OpenAI if needed

### **3. Vector Database: Chroma**
**Why Switch from Pinecone:**
- **Cost**: 85%+ savings ($0-10/month vs $70/month)
- **Open Source**: Full control, no vendor lock-in
- **Startup Friendly**: Perfect for early-stage development and scaling
- **Integration**: Excellent Python/JavaScript integration
- **Performance**: Sufficient for anticipated user loads

**Scaling Strategy**: Start with Chroma, can migrate to managed solutions later if needed
