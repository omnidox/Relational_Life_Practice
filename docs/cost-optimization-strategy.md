## üöÄ **Technology Decisions & Rationale**

### **1. AI Service: Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
**Why Switch from GPT-4:**
- **Cost**: 40% savings ($15/1M vs $25/1M tokens)
- **Performance**: Comparable to GPT-4o, often superior for reasoning tasks
- **Speed**: Faster response times than GPT-4
- **Context Window**: Large context window suitable for relationship conversations
- **Safety**: Strong built-in safety features appropriate for sensitive content

**Risk Mitigation**: Can easily switch back to GPT-4 if needed - same API patterns

### **2. Embeddings: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (100% Cost Savings)**
**Why Switch from OpenAI ada-002:**
- **Cost**: 100% savings (completely free vs $0.13/1M tokens)
- **Performance**: 90% performance vs premium alternatives (5% difference acceptable for educational content)
- **Quality**: Proven in production, excellent for relationship domain content
- **Independence**: No vendor lock-in, completely local processing
- **Speed**: Zero configuration with ChromaDB, works immediately

**Implementation**: Process Terry Real corpus with all-MiniLM-L6-v2, no fallback needed for educational content

### **3. Vector Database: ChromaDB**
**Why Switch from Pinecone:**
- **Cost**: 85%+ savings ($0-10/month vs $70/month)
- **Open Source**: Full control, no vendor lock-in
- **Startup Friendly**: Perfect for early-stage development and scaling
- **Integration**: Excellent Python/JavaScript integration, zero configuration
- **Performance**: Sufficient for anticipated user loads

**Scaling Strategy**: Start with ChromaDB, can migrate to managed solutions later if needed

### **4. Hosting Strategy: Hybrid Vercel ‚Üí AWS Lightsail**
**Why Hybrid Approach:**
- **Development**: Vercel free tier for rapid iteration and zero upfront costs
- **Production**: AWS Lightsail for predictable pricing and eliminated scaling risk
- **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid Vercel's exponential scaling trap (Cara.app $96k case study)
- **Career Value**: AWS experience more valuable than platform-specific skills
- **Cost Control**: $25 Vercel spending caps ‚Üí $20-40/month predictable AWS costs

---

## üìà **Implementation Strategy (Hybrid Approach)**

### **Phase 1: Development on Vercel (Weeks 1-4)**
1. **Set up Vercel with mandatory spending controls** - $25 maximum spending caps
2. **Integrate Claude 3.5 Sonnet API** - Better price/performance for conversations
3. **Implement all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings** - Process Terry Real content at 100% savings
4. **Deploy ChromaDB locally** - Zero configuration, immediate development

### **Phase 2: Migration Preparation (Week 5)**
1. **AWS Lightsail environment setup** - Parallel production environment
2. **Migration testing** - Database and application deployment validation
3. **Cost monitoring setup** - Track Vercel usage and migration triggers
4. **Documentation** - Record migration process for portfolio value

### **Phase 3: Strategic Migration (Weeks 6-8)**
- **Migration Triggers**: Vercel costs >$15/month OR user growth OR Month 2
- **Target Platform**: AWS Lightsail with predictable $20-40/month costs
- **Benefits**: 80%+ cost reduction, AWS experience, eliminated scaling risk

### **Phase 3: Future Scaling Strategy**
- **10,000+ users**: Consider managed vector database services
- **High volume**: Evaluate self-hosted language models
- **Enterprise needs**: Add premium service tiers with original stack
