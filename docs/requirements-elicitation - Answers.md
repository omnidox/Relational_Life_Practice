# Requirements Elicitation Session - Initial Discovery

## üéØ Purpose
Gather foundational information to inform PRD development and architectural decisions.

## üìã Key Questions for Product Owner/Stakeholder

### 1. Target Audience & Market Positioning
**Question**: Who is your primary audience - couples seeking relationship help, therapists-in-training, or general consumers interested in relationship skills? 

My primary audience is the **general consumer**, particularly individuals who feel disconnected in their relationships or who are seeking to improve their relational skills in a personal, accessible way. Inspired by Terry Real‚Äôs critique of Western society‚Äôs overemphasis on individualism and superiority ("better than or less than" mentalities), this platform is designed to help users **relearn and practice the relational skills** that many people have never been taught ‚Äî or have lost touch with.

The core mission is to support emotional connection and mutual understanding. I want people to use this app the way they use Duolingo: casually, consistently, and with intrinsic motivation. The deeper goal is to help **rebuild our capacity for connection as a species** by helping people become more relational in everyday life.



**Question**: Are you planning to launch as a consumer app, B2B tool for therapists, or both?

The initial launch will target **consumers via a mobile app**, available through the **Google Play Store** (and eventually the App Store). The app will have a user-friendly onboarding process with **easy account creation via Google, Facebook, or email sign-ins**. Come to think of it, it would be nice if people can connect here as well (this nis not a priority though).

Users will access structured learning modules in a gamified format similar to Duolingo, focusing on:

-   Practicing relational conversations
    
-   Learning emotional regulation techniques
    
-   Receiving empathetic feedback and reflection prompts
    

A **web-based version** will also be developed for those who prefer desktop interaction, using the same login system.

**Long-term**, I plan to introduce:

-   **Exclusive features for therapists**, such as client-side modules, therapist dashboards, or supervised role-play environments
    
-   Potential **B2B integrations** for clinics and wellness platforms

**Impact on Requirements**:
- User interface complexity and design approach
- Content delivery and progression models
- Privacy and safety requirements
- Marketing and distribution strategy
- Pricing and monetization decisions

### 2. Technical Constraints & Delivery Timeline
**Question**: What's your preferred tech stack and deployment approach? 

Whatever is best for this project, i'm not pressed with one tech stack or another. 


**Question**: Are you planning for web-first, mobile-first, or cross-platform? 

as we said before, i would prefer mobile as a priority, but eventually i would like to integrate it as both mobile and web. However, now that i think of it, maybe we should kill two birds with one stone and make this software as a web app?


**Question**: What's your target timeline for MVP vs. full product launch?

There is no target timeline. Should i focus on one? Maybe a timeline will be more clear once we finish research and requirements elicitaiton? 

**Impact on Requirements**:
- Architecture and infrastructure decisions
- Development resource planning
- Feature prioritization for MVP
- Platform-specific requirements
- Performance and scalability needs

### 3. Content Depth & Therapeutic Boundaries
**Question**: How closely do you want to follow Terry Real's specific RLT methodology vs. creating a more general relational skills curriculum? 

Terry real is a master of this craft, so I would like to rely on him strongly for RLT methodology. That being said, if there are other reputable sources that can strengthen RLT, i'm open to that as well. I want it known that this does not replace therapy, but is meant to serve as practice for RLT techniques. 

**Question**: What are your thoughts on the ethical boundaries between educational content and actual therapy?

We need to ensure to let people know that we are not a replacement for therapists. We are just meant for practicing rlt techniques and skills to refine them so they can use them with people they meet throughout their life. 

**Impact on Requirements**:
- Content development and licensing needs
- Legal compliance and liability considerations
- User safety and crisis intervention features
- Professional consultation requirements
- Certification and credentialing aspects

### 4. Business Model & Monetization Strategy
**Question**: Are you envisioning a freemium model like Duolingo, subscription-based, or something else? This affects our technical architecture decisions around user management and content delivery.

I'm not sure. What do you think is the best model? Actually now that i think of it, since i'm making this project not only to practice my skills, but as a way to show off to prospective employers, would this affect what model i'll choose?



**Impact on Requirements**:
- User account and payment system architecture
- Content gating and progression mechanics
- Analytics and conversion tracking needs
- Customer support and retention features
- Revenue optimization capabilities

### 5. AI Integration Philosophy & Scope
**Question**: Beyond conversational practice, where else do you see AI playing a role - personalized learning paths, progress assessment, content adaptation, or therapeutic response analysis?

AI could eventually be leveraged to do many things. But the main thing i would like for it to do is to test and roleplay with the user to refine their relational skills and abilities. But come to think of it, maybe ai can be used at the end of a chapter or section within our app. Our app could teach the user one a core concept, then the ai, with the knowledge that these core concepts are to be tested, now roleplays with the user to ensure that the core concept is understood. Would a single ai be able to handle this? 

**Impact on Requirements**:
- AI/ML infrastructure and model selection
- Data collection and privacy considerations
- Personalization algorithm complexity
- Real-time vs. batch processing needs
- Human oversight and safety mechanisms

## üîÑ Requirements Elicitation Process

### Traditional Approach
1. **Stakeholder Interviews** ‚Üí Document responses
2. **Requirements Analysis** ‚Üí Identify conflicts and gaps
3. **Validation** ‚Üí Confirm understanding with stakeholders
4. **Documentation** ‚Üí Formal requirements specification

### Our AI-Assisted Approach
1. **Strategic Questions** ‚Üí Human provides vision and constraints
2. **AI Research Support** ‚Üí Market analysis and technical feasibility
3. **Collaborative Analysis** ‚Üí Human-AI synthesis of findings
4. **Iterative Refinement** ‚Üí Continuous validation and improvement

## üìù Next Steps

Once you provide answers to these foundational questions, we can:
1. **Focus our market research** on relevant competitors and user segments
2. **Scope our technical feasibility study** around your preferred approaches
3. **Define ethical guidelines** that align with your therapeutic boundary preferences
4. **Plan our architecture** with your business model and AI integration vision
5. **Create realistic timelines** based on your constraints and priorities
