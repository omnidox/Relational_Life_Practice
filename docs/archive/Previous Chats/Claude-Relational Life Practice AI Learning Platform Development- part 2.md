# Product Requirements Document
## Relational Life Practice AI Learning Platform

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: May 24, 2025  
**Author**: Rafael Hidalgo  
**Status**: Final Draft  

---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

### **Product Vision**
Relational Life Practice is an AI-powered learning platform that makes relationship skills accessible, engaging, and practical through gamified conversational practice and structured learning paths. Inspired by Terry Real's Relational Life Therapy (RLT), our mission is to **rebuild humanity's capacity for connection** by teaching the relational skills that many people have never learned.

### **The Problem**
Western society's emphasis on individualism has created a crisis of connection. People struggle in relationships not due to lack of love, but due to lack of relational skills. Traditional therapy is expensive and inaccessible, while existing relationship apps focus on matching rather than skill development.

### **The Solution**
A Duolingo-style learning platform that teaches relational skills through:
- **AI-powered roleplay scenarios** for safe practice
- **Terry Real's proven RLT methodology** delivered through engaging digital experiences
- **Real-life conversation analysis** to bridge learning and application
- **Gamified progression** that makes difficult emotional work approachable

### **Success Vision**
Users engage "casually, consistently, and with intrinsic motivation" to develop authentic relational skills that improve their real-world connections, while we demonstrate cutting-edge AI application in emotional intelligence and education.

## Prompt:
it replied with the below

You're all set! The **Relational Learning Architect** GPT is ready in the preview to your right. You can try it out and see how it performs. I'm here to refine it further if you'd like to adjust its behavior, tone, or features. What would you like to do next?



## Response:
Perfect! Now it's time to test and upload your knowledge files. Here's what to do next:

## üß™ **Phase 1: Initial Testing**

**Try these test prompts** in the preview to see how it responds:

1. **"Help me design a curriculum for teaching 'The Five Losing Strategies' from Terry Real's work to adults new to relationship education."**

2. **"Create a lesson structure that combines Terry Real's boundary-setting concepts with Duolingo's gamification approach."**

3. **"What questions should I ask to understand my target audience before designing relationship curriculum?"**

## üìÅ **Phase 2: Upload Knowledge Files**

Look for the **Knowledge** section in the configuration (usually below the instructions). Upload your 4 files:
- `terry-real-how-can-i-get-through-to-you.pdf`
- `terry-real-new-rules-of-marriage.pdf` 
- `terry-real-us-getting-past-you-and-me.pdf`
- `duolingo-research-comprehensive.md`

## üîß **Phase 3: Enhanced Testing**

After uploading, test with more specific prompts:

**"Based on Terry Real's books and Duolingo's methodology, design a complete 5-module curriculum for adults learning relationship skills. Include progression logic, gamification elements, and practice scenarios."**

## üí° **Next Steps**

Once you've tested it and uploaded the files, we can:
1. **Refine the instructions** based on initial responses
2. **Generate our complete curriculum** for the platform
3. **Export the learning architecture** to implement in our RAG system
4. **Document this process** for your Medium article content!

**Start with the initial testing - how does it respond to those first prompts?**



## Prompt:
we chose 5 modules below, but should we ask chat gpt how many modules we should work with upon reviewing all documents in it's knowledge base. Perhaps even ask it how many modules it recommends and how those modules should be split? And if there is any other thing it would recommend us to think about that we haven't considered? 

Based on Terry Real's books and Duolingo's methodology, design a complete 5-module curriculum for adults learning relationship skills. Include progression logic, gamification elements, and practice scenarios.



## Response:
Absolutely brilliant strategic thinking! That's exactly the kind of expert consultation we should be leveraging. Let's ask the GPT to analyze the comprehensive knowledge base and make evidence-based recommendations rather than forcing our preconceptions.

Here's a better approach:

## üéØ **Strategic Consultation Prompt**

**"I'm building a relationship skills learning platform. After reviewing Terry Real's complete methodology from all three books and analyzing Duolingo's learning science principles, please recommend:**

**1. OPTIMAL MODULE STRUCTURE**
- How many modules would be most effective for comprehensive relationship skill development?
- What should be the logical progression and why?
- Which Terry Real concepts are foundational vs. advanced?

**2. LEARNING ARCHITECTURE**  
- How should modules build upon each other?
- What's the optimal length/scope per module?
- Are there natural breaking points in Terry Real's methodology?

**3. GAMIFICATION INTEGRATION**
- Which relationship concepts work best with Duolingo-style progression?
- What gamification elements are appropriate vs. potentially harmful for sensitive relationship work?
- How can we maintain engagement without trivializing emotional growth?

**4. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS**
- What haven't I considered that could impact curriculum effectiveness?
- Are there prerequisites or foundational concepts users need first?
- What would make this curriculum uniquely valuable compared to generic relationship advice?

**Base your recommendations on the comprehensive analysis of both knowledge sources, not assumptions."**

This approach:
‚úÖ **Leverages the GPT's complete knowledge synthesis**
‚úÖ **Gets expert-level curriculum architecture recommendations** 
‚úÖ **Identifies gaps in our thinking**
‚úÖ **Ensures evidence-based design decisions**
‚úÖ **Creates superior content for your professional portfolio**

This is exactly the kind of strategic AI utilization that demonstrates advanced thinking to potential employers - letting AI analyze comprehensive data to inform human decision-making rather than just executing predetermined plans.

actually before we continue, are any of the above redundant?



## Response:
Great question! Let me analyze for redundancy:

## üîç **Redundancy Analysis**

### **‚úÖ Essential Documents (Keep All)**
1. **`chatgpt-curriculum-architect-session.md`** - Complete consultation log
2. **`curriculum-architecture-summary.md`** - Executive summary for quick reference
3. **`project-dashboard.md`** - Active project management
4. **`PRD/product-requirements-v1.md`** - Official product specification
5. **`README.md`** - Project overview and status

### **üîÑ Potentially Redundant Updates**

**6. `/docs/mvp-roadmap.md` vs 4. PRD** 
- **MVP Roadmap**: Job search timeline focus
- **PRD**: Complete product specification
- **Verdict**: **Keep both** - different audiences and purposes

**7. `/articles/content-creation-backlog.md` vs 8. `comprehensive-content-strategy.md`**
- **Backlog**: Ready-to-draft articles with sources
- **Strategy**: Overall content approach and calendar
- **Verdict**: **Keep both** - backlog is tactical, strategy is strategic

**3. `/docs/project-dashboard.md` vs 4. `/docs/week-2-implementation-plan.md`**
- **Dashboard**: Overall project status tracking
- **Week 2 Plan**: Specific implementation phase details
- **Verdict**: **Keep both** - different time horizons

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Actually Redundant**

**9. `/docs/AI-Collaboration-Process/development-workflow.md`** 
- **Overlap**: Content opportunities already covered in comprehensive strategy
- **Unique Value**: Process methodology (worth keeping)
- **Verdict**: **Light update only** - just add one line about systematic module approach

## üéØ **Streamlined Update List (9 ‚Üí 8 Documents)**

### **Full Updates (7 documents)**
1. `chatgpt-curriculum-architect-session.md` - Complete consultation log
2. `curriculum-architecture-summary.md` - Executive summary
3. `project-dashboard.md` - Project management
4. `week-2-implementation-plan.md` - Technical implementation
5. `PRD/product-requirements-v1.md` - Product specification
6. `mvp-roadmap.md` - Job search timeline
7. `content-creation-backlog.md` - Ready-to-draft articles

### **Light Update (1 document)**
8. `development-workflow.md` - Just add systematic approach note

### **Skip Update**
- `comprehensive-content-strategy.md` - Already comprehensively updated
- `README.md` - Already updated with major status

## ‚úÖ **Optimized Approach**

**8 focused updates** instead of 10, eliminating true redundancy while maintaining comprehensive documentation. This saves time while ensuring all critical information is captured.

**Ready to proceed with streamlined documentation tracking!**



## Prompt:
should we delete any of the redundant files?



## Response:


**sequentialthinking**

*Request*

```javascript
{
  "thought": "Let me think carefully about whether we should delete any files. I need to consider:\n\n1. Are any files truly redundant (same information, same purpose)?\n2. Do any files serve different audiences or purposes even if they overlap?\n3. What's the risk vs benefit of deletion?\n4. What does good project organization look like?\n\nLooking at the files I identified:\n\n- The content strategy vs content backlog both serve different purposes (strategic planning vs tactical execution)\n- The project dashboard vs week 2 plan serve different time horizons \n- The PRD vs MVP roadmap serve different audiences (product spec vs job search timeline)\n- The development workflow actually serves a unique purpose (process documentation)\n\nActually, looking more closely, I don't think we have truly redundant files. Each serves a specific purpose:\n\n1. chatgpt-curriculum-architect-session.md - Session log/consultation record\n2. curriculum-architecture-summary.md - Executive summary\n3. project-dashboard.md - Active project management \n4. week-2-implementation-plan.md - Phase-specific technical plan\n5. PRD - Official product requirements\n6. mvp-roadmap.md - Job search focused timeline\n7. content-creation-backlog.md - Tactical content ready to draft\n8. comprehensive-content-strategy.md - Strategic content planning\n9. development-workflow.md - Process methodology documentation\n\nEach has a distinct purpose and audience. The only potential redundancy might be if some get outdated, but for an active project, having multiple views (strategic, tactical, executive summary, detailed specs) is actually valuable.\n\nFor a professional portfolio project, having comprehensive documentation from multiple angles demonstrates thoroughness and professional project management skills.\n",

**sequentialthinking**

*Request*

```javascript
{
  "thought": "Actually, I think my analysis was wrong about redundancy. Let me reconsider what \"redundant\" means in this context:\n\nRedundant = serves exactly the same purpose with the same information\nvs\nOverlapping = covers some similar ground but serves different purposes\n\nLooking again at our files:\n- Session log vs executive summary = different formats, same core info but different purposes (complete record vs quick reference)\n- Project dashboard vs implementation plan = different time scopes and detail levels\n- Content backlog vs content strategy = tactical vs strategic\n- PRD vs MVP roadmap = product specification vs job search timeline\n\nNone of these are truly redundant - they're overlapping but serve different purposes and audiences. For a professional portfolio project, this level of documentation actually demonstrates:\n\n1. Systematic project management\n2. Multi-stakeholder thinking (different docs for different audiences)\n3. Professional documentation practices\n4. Comprehensive planning and execution\n\nThe risk of deletion:\n- Losing valuable context or specific details\n- Reducing professional portfolio depth\n- Having to recreate information later\n- Missing documentation that serves specific purposes\n\nThe benefit of deletion:\n- Slightly cleaner file structure\n- Less maintenance overhead\n\nThe risk far outweighs the benefit. For a portfolio project, comprehensive documentation is a feature, not a bug. It shows professional project management skills.\n\nMy recommendation: Keep all files, but ensure each has a clear, distinct purpose and is maintained appropriately.\n",

  "thoughtNumber": 2,
  "totalThoughts": 2,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "branches": [],
  "thoughtHistoryLength": 2
}
```

**No, I recommend keeping all files.** Here's why:

## üéØ **Professional Portfolio Value**

### **Each File Serves a Distinct Purpose**
- **Session Log**: Complete consultation record (audit trail)
- **Executive Summary**: Quick reference for stakeholders
- **Project Dashboard**: Active management tool
- **Implementation Plan**: Phase-specific technical details
- **PRD**: Official product specification
- **MVP Roadmap**: Job search timeline focus
- **Content Backlog**: Ready-to-draft tactical list
- **Content Strategy**: Strategic planning document

### **Documentation Depth = Professional Strength**

**For Portfolio Showcase**:
‚úÖ **Multi-stakeholder thinking** - Different docs for different audiences  
‚úÖ **Professional project management** - Comprehensive planning and tracking  
‚úÖ **Systematic approach** - Multiple levels of detail and purpose  
‚úÖ **Maintenance discipline** - Keeping documentation current and organized  

**For Employer Appeal**:
- Shows ability to manage complex projects with proper documentation
- Demonstrates strategic thinking across multiple time horizons
- Indicates professional development practices
- Suggests strong organizational and communication skills

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risks of Deletion**

- **Lose specific context** that might be valuable later
- **Reduce portfolio depth** and professional demonstration
- **Create gaps** in project narrative and decision tracking
- **Miss different audience needs** (technical vs strategic vs tactical)

## ‚úÖ **Recommendation: Keep All, Optimize Updates**

**Better approach**: Maintain clear **file purposes** and **update efficiently**

### **File Purpose Clarity**
Each document has a **README section** explaining its specific role and audience

### **Smart Update Strategy**
- **Major updates**: Core curriculum documents (2-3 files)
- **Minor updates**: Status and progress tracking (3-4 files)  
- **Reference updates**: Content and strategy documents (1-2 files)

**Result**: Professional documentation depth with efficient maintenance.

**The comprehensive documentation is actually a portfolio strength, not redundancy!**

## Prompt:
the project dashboard is what i'm using to see where i'm at workflow wise correct? Is this the main document handling this?



## Response:
Yes, you're absolutely right! The **Project Dashboard** (`/docs/project-dashboard.md`) is designed to be your **main workflow management document** - your central command center for tracking where you are in the development process.

## üìã **Project Dashboard as Primary Workflow Tool**

### **Current Structure**
- **Current Sprint status** (Week 2)
- **TOP PRIORITY TASKS** with completion status
- **4-Week MVP Roadmap** overview
- **Success Metrics & KPIs** tracking
- **Current Blockers & Risks** identification
- **Daily/Weekly Process** guidelines
- **Progress Tracking** with next priority actions

### **Key Workflow Features**
‚úÖ **Task Status Tracking** - Clear completion status for major deliverables  
‚úÖ **Priority Management** - TOP PRIORITY section for focus  
‚úÖ **Progress Percentage** - Overall project advancement  
‚úÖ **Next Actions** - Clear direction for what to work on next  
‚úÖ **Timeline Tracking** - 4-week MVP schedule management  

## üí° **Should We Enhance It Further?**

Since this is your primary workflow document, we could:

### **Option 1: Keep Current Structure** 
- Dashboard provides high-level project management
- Use it alongside specific implementation documents

### **Option 2: Enhance Dashboard as Central Hub**
- Add more detailed **daily task breakdown**
- Include **immediate next steps** section
- Add **decision tracking** for quick reference
- Create **weekly sprint planning** integration

**What would work best for your workflow?** Should we:
- **Keep it as-is** (strategic overview + priority tracking)
- **Enhance it** with more detailed task management
- **Create a separate** daily/weekly task tracker that references the dashboard

The dashboard is definitely your main workflow document - just want to make sure it's structured optimally for how you work!



## Prompt:
are there other documents that is handling our workflow?



## Response:
Yes, there are several documents handling different aspects of our workflow. Let me map them out:

## üìã **Current Workflow Documents**

### **1. Primary Project Management**
- **`/docs/project-dashboard.md`** - Main project status and milestone tracking
- **`/docs/week-2-implementation-plan.md`** - Detailed phase-specific task breakdown

### **2. Content Creation Workflow**
- **`/articles/content-creation-backlog.md`** - Ready-to-draft articles with sources
- **`/articles/comprehensive-content-strategy.md`** - Content calendar and publishing strategy

### **3. Process Documentation**
- **`/docs/AI-Collaboration-Process/development-workflow.md`** - Human-AI collaboration methodology
- **`/docs/session-documentation-may-24-foundation.md`** - Historical session tracking

## üîÑ **Potential Workflow Overlap/Confusion**

### **Task Management Spread Across:**
- **Project Dashboard** - High-level milestones and priorities
- **Week 2 Plan** - Detailed technical implementation tasks  
- **Content Backlog** - Article writing tasks and timelines

### **Progress Tracking Duplicated In:**
- **Dashboard** - Overall project progress
- **Week 2 Plan** - Phase-specific progress
- **README** - External project status

## üí° **Recommendation: Streamline Workflow Management**

### **Option 1: Consolidate to Dashboard Only**
- Make Project Dashboard the **single source of truth**
- Move detailed tasks from Week 2 Plan into Dashboard
- Reference other documents but track all progress centrally

### **Option 2: Clear Role Separation**
- **Dashboard** = Strategic milestones and weekly priorities
- **Week 2 Plan** = Detailed technical task breakdown
- **Content Backlog** = Content creation workflow only

### **Option 3: Create Master Workflow Document**
- New central workflow manager that coordinates all other documents
- Clear hierarchy and reference system

**Which approach would work best for your workflow style?** 

I think we might have too many workflow documents competing for attention. Should we consolidate or clearly define each document's role?



## Prompt:
the below too correct? 


"D:\Github\Relational_Life_Practice\docs\planning-tasks.md"



## Response:
Yes, absolutely! Let me check that document:

- Reference technical details from Week 2 plan but track progress centrally

**Option B: Clear Document Hierarchy**
- **Dashboard** = Master project status and weekly priorities
- **Phase Plans** = Detailed task breakdowns (Week 2, Week 3, etc.)
- **Content Backlog** = Content creation workflow only
- **Archive** = Outdated planning documents

**Which approach would you prefer for cleaner workflow management?**



## Prompt:
let's do the below

**Option B: Clear Document Hierarchy**
* **Dashboard** = Master project status and weekly priorities
* **Phase Plans** = Detailed task breakdowns (Week 2, Week 3, etc.)
* **Content Backlog** = Content creation workflow only
* **Archive** = Outdated planning documents



## Response:
Perfect! Let's implement **Option B: Clear Document Hierarchy**. I'll organize the workflow documents with clear roles and move outdated content to archive.

## Prompt:
we should probably focus on finalizing on finalizing our prd shouldn't we?



## Response:
You're absolutely right! While we have a lot of great curriculum architecture work completed, the **PRD should be our definitive product specification** that everything flows from. Let's make sure it's truly complete and polished as our master product document.

## üéØ **PRD Status Check**

Looking at our current PRD v2.0, we have:
‚úÖ **Complete 12-module curriculum integration**  
‚úÖ **Updated AI conversation requirements**  
‚úÖ **Enhanced gamification specifications**  
‚úÖ **Technical architecture updates**  

But we should review and potentially enhance:

### **Areas to Consider for PRD Finalization:**

1. **Technical Specifications Section**
   - Database schema requirements
   - API endpoints specification  
   - Performance requirements
   - Security and privacy details

2. **Implementation Roadmap Integration**
   - How our 12-module architecture maps to development phases
   - MVP vs advanced feature prioritization clarity
   - Resource and timeline estimates

3. **Success Metrics & KPIs**
   - Learning effectiveness measurement
   - User engagement metrics
   - Business metrics alignment

4. **Risk Assessment Updates**
   - Technical risks with complex curriculum
   - Content safety and therapeutic boundaries
   - Scalability considerations

5. **Go-to-Market Strategy**
   - How complete curriculum affects market positioning
   - Content marketing integration with our article strategy

## üí° **Should we:**

**Option A**: Review current PRD and identify specific gaps to fill
**Option B**: Do a comprehensive PRD review and polish session  
**Option C**: Focus on specific PRD sections that need the most work

**What aspects of the PRD do you think need the most attention to make it truly complete and ready for stakeholder review or technical handoff?**



## Prompt:
before we continue, do we need to complete an srs or sdd right after the prd? does the dashboard, or any of the documents discuss this in the workflow?



## Response:
Great question! Let me check our workflow documents to see what technical specification documents we've planned:

*PRD Review completed by AI collaboration partner | Quality validated for implementation readiness*

```

Excellent! Looking at our documentation strategy, I can see we **do have a planned progression**:

## üìã **Planned Document Progression**

### **Our Documentation Strategy Defines:**
1. **PRD** (Product Requirements Document) ‚úÖ **Nearly Complete**
2. **SRS** (Software Requirements Specification) üìã **Next Step**  
3. **SDD** (Software Design Document) üîÑ **Following SRS**

### **Current Status from PRD Quality Review:**
- **PRD Quality Score**: 9.2/10 - Ready for implementation
- **Recommendation**: "Proceed with confidence to Week 2 technical implementation"
- **Week 2 Prerequisites** include: "Create Technical Specification Document (TSD)"

### **What Our Workflow Shows:**

**From Week 2 Implementation Plan:**
- Task mentions "Technical Specification Document (TSD)" creation
- Custom GPT consultation included technical implementation requirements

**From Documentation Strategy:**  
- **SRS** should translate business requirements to technical requirements
- **SDD** should provide architectural blueprint and implementation guidance

## üí° **Strategic Decision Point**

**Option A: Finalize PRD ‚Üí Create SRS ‚Üí Create SDD** (Full traditional approach)
**Option B: Finalize PRD ‚Üí Create Combined Technical Specification** (Streamlined for MVP)
**Option C: Use Custom GPT consultation outputs as technical specification foundation**

**My Recommendation**: **Option B** - Create a **comprehensive Technical Specification Document** that combines SRS and SDD elements, because:
- We already have detailed technical requirements from Custom GPT consultation
- MVP timeline benefits from streamlined documentation  
- Our curriculum architecture work already provides many technical specifications

**Should we finalize the PRD first, then create one comprehensive Technical Specification Document that covers both SRS and SDD elements?**



## Prompt:
sure we'll do the below. 

Should we edit any documents to reflect this new change in path?

**My Recommendation**: **Option B** - Create a **comprehensive Technical Specification Document** that combines SRS and SDD elements, because:

# Product Requirements Document
## Relational Life Practice AI Learning Platform

**Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: May 25, 2025 (Major Update)  
**Author**: Rafael Hidalgo  
**Status**: Complete Curriculum Architecture Integration  
**Major Update**: Complete 12-module evidence-based structure, all technical specifications, advanced gamification strategy  

---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

### **Product Vision**
Relational Life Practice is an AI-powered learning platform that makes relationship skills accessible, engaging, and practical through gamified conversational practice and structured learning paths. Inspired by Terry Real's Relational Life Therapy (RLT), our mission is to **rebuild humanity's capacity for connection** by teaching the relational skills that many people have never learned.

### **The Problem**
Western society's emphasis on individualism has created a crisis of connection. People struggle in relationships not due to lack of love, but due to lack of relational skills. Traditional therapy is expensive and inaccessible, while existing relationship apps focus on matching rather than skill development.

### **The Solution**

## üìÖ **4-Week MVP Roadmap**

### **Week 1: Foundation & Research** (Current)
- ‚úÖ Requirements elicitation complete
- ‚úÖ Project structure organized  
- üéØ **PRD completion** (primary deliverable)
- üéØ **Competitive analysis** 
- üéØ **First Medium article**
- üéØ **Terry Real corpus acquisition**

### **Week 2: Knowledge Base & RAG Setup**

- Technical architecture documentation

### **Week 3: User Experience & Learning Flow**
- User authentication system
- Learning progression UI/UX
- Medium article on safe AI design
- Initial user testing with friends/family
- Complete learning loop implementation

### **Week 4: Polish & Launch Prep**
```

You're absolutely right! Our dashboard is missing clear **workflow progression** and **comprehensive history**. Currently it shows:

## üìã **Current Dashboard Issues**

### **‚úÖ What It Has:**
- Current sprint status
- Top priority tasks with completion status
- 4-week roadmap overview

### **‚ùå What It's Missing:**
- **Complete history** of accomplished work
- **Clear workflow sequence** showing what leads to what
- **Visual progress tracking** through phases
- **Comprehensive achievement log**

## üí° **Should We Enhance the Dashboard?**

**Option A: Add History & Workflow Sections**
- **üìà Project History** - Chronicle of major accomplishments
- **üîÑ Workflow Pipeline** - Clear sequence of tasks and dependencies
- **‚úÖ Achievement Log** - Comprehensive record of completed work

**Option B: Keep Dashboard Simple, Create Separate Workflow Tracker**
- Dashboard stays high-level status
- Create dedicated `/docs/workflow-tracker.md` with detailed progression

**Option C: Restructure Dashboard as Complete Workflow Authority**
- **Phase 1 History** (Foundation & Research) - What we accomplished
- **Phase 2 Current** (Technical Implementation) - What we're doing now  
- **Phase 3 Planned** (Development & Launch) - What comes next
- **Clear task dependencies** and workflow sequence

**Which approach would work best for your workflow management? The dashboard should show you exactly where you've been, where you are, and where you're going next.**

I think **Option C** would make the dashboard much more useful as your primary workflow authority!



## Prompt:
let's do the below. Use the prd as the main reference, and any other documents you wish to do the below.


**Option C: Restructure Dashboard as Complete Workflow Authority**
* **Phase 1 History** (Foundation & Research) - What we accomplished
* **Phase 2 Current** (Technical Implementation) - What we're doing now
* **Phase 3 Planned** (Development & Launch) - What comes next
* **Clear task dependencies** and workflow sequence



## Response:
Perfect! Let me restructure the dashboard as a complete workflow authority using the PRD and other key documents as reference.
