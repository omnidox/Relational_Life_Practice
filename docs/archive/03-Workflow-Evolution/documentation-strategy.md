# Project Planning & Documentation Strategy

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This document outlines our systematic approach to building the Relational Life Practice AI Learning Platform, emphasizing thorough planning before implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Documentation Hierarchy

### 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Purpose**: Define what we're building and why  
**Stakeholders**: Product vision, user needs, market positioning  
**Key Sections**:
- Executive Summary & Vision
- Target Audience Analysis
- Core Features & User Stories
- Success Metrics & KPIs
- Go-to-Market Strategy

### 2. Technical Specification Document (TSD) - **STREAMLINED APPROACH**
**Purpose**: Combined SRS + SDD - Technical requirements and architectural blueprint  
**Rationale**: MVP timeline benefits from streamlined documentation; Custom GPT consultation already provides detailed technical requirements  
**Stakeholders**: Development team, QA, architects, future maintainers  
**Key Sections**:
- Functional & Non-Functional Requirements
- System Architecture & Component Design
- Database Schema & Data Models
- API Specifications & Integration Requirements
- AI/RAG Implementation Details
- Security Design & Compliance Guidelines
- Deployment Architecture & Performance Requirements

## ðŸ”„ Research & Documentation Process

### Phase 1: Market & User Research (Week 1)
1. **Competitive Analysis** - Analyze existing relationship education apps
2. **User Persona Development** - Define primary and secondary audiences  
3. **Therapeutic Framework Research** - Deep dive into Terry Real's RLT methodology
4. **Technical Feasibility Study** - Evaluate AI/ML capabilities and constraints

### Phase 2: Requirements & Technical Specification (Week 1-2)
1. **Finalize PRD** - Complete product vision with curriculum architecture integration
2. **Stakeholder Review** - Validate assumptions and priorities  
3. **Comprehensive Technical Specification** - Combined SRS + SDD leveraging Custom GPT consultation outputs
4. **Architecture Validation** - Ensure technical approach supports complete 12-module curriculum

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning & Validation (Week 2-3)
1. **Technical Specification Validation** - Review TSD for completeness and feasibility
2. **Prototype Development** - Build proof-of-concept for core AI interactions  
3. **Risk Assessment** - Identify technical, ethical, and business risks
4. **Implementation Roadmap** - Break down development into sprints based on TSD

## ðŸ“Š Success Criteria

- **PRD**: Clear product vision with complete 12-module curriculum integration and measurable success metrics
- **TSD**: Comprehensive technical specification combining requirements and design, leveraging Custom GPT consultation outputs  
- **Research**: Evidence-based decisions for all major design choices with strategic AI consultation methodology documented
- **Implementation Readiness**: Technical specification detailed enough for immediate development start
