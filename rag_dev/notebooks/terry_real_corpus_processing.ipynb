    "# 🔍 Core Features:\n",
    "# - Multi-Format Pattern Detection: Automatically detects chapters using diverse formats:\n",
    "#     - Numeric: \"Chapter 1\", \"CHAPTER 2\", \"3. Title\"\n",
    "#     - Word-based: \"CHAPTER EIGHT\", \"Chapter Eleven\"\n",
    "#     - Title patterns: First 3 words of actual chapter titles\n",
    "# - Intelligent Number-Word Conversion: Maps 1-20 to \"ONE\", \"EIGHT\", \"SEVENTEEN\", etc.\n",
    "# - Metadata Integration: Leverages existing `chapter_metadata` for targeted title searches\n",
    "# - Content Structure Discovery: Reveals book organization patterns (TOC, main content, appendices)\n",
